## Project Submission

I have completed the assignment as per the initial requirements. Here is a [video demonstration of the initial assignment](https://www.loom.com/share/221ec5fda9814a029e03b84ab2c101f9).

Since the deadline was extended, I took the opportunity to upgrade the project based on new ideas and improvements. I have explained these changes in a separate [video demonstration of the upgraded version](https://www.loom.com/share/d26ab33ae46f49219be9f87be772180d).

### Repository Links

### Note

Hi, I am currently working as a Frontend Developer at QuadB Tech. Today, **November 12**, is the scheduled launch of our project. Due to this, I was unable to take time off on the **11th and 12th** as I am responsible for the entire user-facing side of our application, including testing backend integrations and implementing two new features. I worked overnight to ensure this project was completed but could not host it, so Iâ€™ve provided a detailed video demonstration for reference.

Thank you for your consideration!
